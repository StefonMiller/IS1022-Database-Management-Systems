For my final project I decided to create a mock database that I would later use to fully implement the backend of CamBot. This project was a great opportunity to plan the design of the database and work through some of the problems associated with storing data with that many relationships. In the end, I didn't completely model all relationsihps for the items as it greatly impacted performance.
